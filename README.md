# Lateral Thinking Idea Generator
Program where you click a button and it will show you two random ideas next to each other

1) have it display three cards next to each other. On the left two cards will be the idea name at the top, the idea or principle in the middle, and then hashtags at the bottom. The hashtags will be from what field of study they come from and any other related ideas. So a neurophilosophy card would be #neurophilosophy #neuroscience #philosophy #relatedTerm 

2) It will also have either #Established or #Generated, the first being a term I learned from studying. then the second being a term I created from this program

3) Each box will have an X in the top right hand corner that will close the card and generate a new one

4) the third card is one you can create from this program. all the card information gets stored in an airtable 

5) you can generate cards from speicifc hashtags. like put in #philosophy #psychology and it will bring up a card of each 

6) include a 4th card that can be used to ask questions, like pull questions from the six thinking hats book 

# Photography Idea Generator

Same concept as above but instead of creating new cards you are just using it as a way of creating permutations. This might be useful from the standpoint of offloading permutation generator onto the computer. Allows you to use brain power for evaluating the mix of ideas. I don't know how meaningful this would actually be but the permutation implemation wouldn't be that different or too hard.

You'll select three out of four categories
1. Time - ex. Sunset
2. Place - ex. Trail Behind House
3. Idea Explored - ex. Dog

# Storytelling Generator

Same idea above but it will be a synthesis of what I learned from the Storytelling books I am currently reading. Incorporate the ideas from the following books into the generator
1. Storytelling books on iPad
2. Storytelling books in Calibre
3. Hardcopy Storytelling Books I own - Hero of Thousand Faces
4. Any I can remember from College - the cat one for example
5. Psychology Books - The information from introductry textbooks I have
6. Psychology Books - Find out the other good books on the research around Personality
7. Pull the major authors of the past and condense their main themes and ideas explored

# Comedy Generator
1. Abstract Comedy concepts. Think of the comedic concepts you have been pulling from Far Side. Like "Mismatch in History" where he is essentially reimaging modern experiences(picking what couch you want out of a catalog) as caveman experiences(picking which fire they want out of a catalog). With the joke being all the fires are the same and the ridiculous nature of it. 
2. So the generator would pull a card like this out of the pile, then pull a concept out of the pile like Amor Fati. Or ect. 
3. Or you could have it where the generator pulls out other cards such as
   a. Time - when in history
   b. Place - where in history
   c. Time and Place Together - ex. French Revolution - this might be the better idea 
4. Write out a brief description of what Comedy is. Rewatch that Rogan/Cornell West episode if needed.

### Fast Extract
Problem - there is a list of 100 most influential authors. I want the names without all the other mubo jumbo form the articles. How would I do this? 
   Option 1 - Are the authors listed as elements on the page that would allow me to webscrape them
   Option 2 - Use deletion tools alongside incremental reading software to just parse out the names. For this to be time efficent though, it would be nice to be able to import the names and then add them each as an individual cell on Airtable
