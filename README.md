# Lateral Thinking Idea Generator
Program where you click a button and it will show you two random ideas next to each other

1) have it display three cards next to each other. On the left two cards will be the idea name at the top, the idea or principle in the middle, and then hashtags at the bottom. The hashtags will be from what field of study they come from and any other related ideas. So a neurophilosophy card would be #neurophilosophy #neuroscience #philosophy #relatedTerm 

2) It will also have either #Established or #Generated, the first being a term I learned from studying. then the second being a term I created from this program

3) Each box will have an X in the top right hand corner that will close the card and generate a new one

4) the third card is one you can create from this program. all the card information gets stored in an airtable 

5) you can generate cards from speicifc hashtags. like put in #philosophy #psychology and it will bring up a card of each
